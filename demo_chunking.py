    Welcome to the revolutionary text-to-speech system with automatic chunking capabilities!
    This advanced system can now handle documents of virtually any length without user intervention.
    
    The intelligent chunking algorithm analyzes your text and automatically splits it at natural
    boundaries such as sentence endings, clause breaks, or word boundaries. This ensures that
    the speech synthesis maintains natural flow and pronunciation across all segments.
    
    Performance has been dramatically improved through several key innovations. First, individual
    text chunks are cached separately, allowing for instant reuse of common text segments.
    Second, the final stitched audio is also cached, providing immediate playback for repeated
    content. Third, the system provides real-time progress tracking for long operations.
    
    The user experience has been carefully designed to be completely transparent. Users simply
    paste or type their text, regardless of length, and click generate. The system automatically
    determines if chunking is needed and handles all the complexity behind the scenes.
    
    Technical implementation includes smart boundary detection, memory-efficient audio processing,
    graceful error handling, and comprehensive performance monitoring. The system can process
    everything from short phrases to entire books with equal ease and efficiency.
    
    This enhancement makes the TTS system suitable for a wide range of applications including
    document narration, educational content creation, accessibility tools, and content production.
    The automatic chunking feature removes all previous limitations and opens up new possibilities.
    
    Quality is maintained throughout the process through careful audio stitching with configurable
    silence gaps between chunks. The result is seamless, natural-sounding speech that flows
    smoothly from beginning to end, regardless of the original text length.
    
    Future enhancements will include parallel chunk processing for even faster generation,
    advanced caching strategies based on semantic similarity, and support for specialized
    document formats with automatic structure detection and optimization.
